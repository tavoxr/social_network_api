# social_network_api
API based on basic facebook functions using Django.
It's a basic api created with django and using all benefits rest-fremwork give us to simplify the code,
like ReadOnlyModelViewSet, GenericViewSet and mixins to manage views, also use serializer, filters.
I used the default database sqlite3 but also you can click the link https://social-api18.herokuapp.com/api/ to check api running in a postgresql db in heroku.
